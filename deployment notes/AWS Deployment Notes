Required for AWS EBS deployment:
Create a ZIP file with:
    application.py (a mod_WSGI file in disguise)
    my_app directory structure
    requirements.txt

Tested with Python 3.6 AWS Linux 2.7.1

Statics:
    In order to find Statics
    Goto EBS Configuration-> Software

    Leave Path: /static/
    CHANGE Directory from: static/ to my_app/static

SmartSheet requires enum34 and enum34 causes the following error
Throws error: flask aws AttributeError: module 'enum' has no attribute 'IntFlag'
In Python 3.6 you can simply REMOVE enum34 to resolve this problem
